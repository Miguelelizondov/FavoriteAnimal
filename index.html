    <p> Dolphins are one of the most intelligent animals and are known for being highly sociable. They show just how social they are by living in pods of up to a dozen individuals. Dolphins establish strong social bonds especially when it comes to injured and ill dolphins. Dolphins will stay with ill and injured dolphins, even helping them breathe. They do this wonderful act by bringing them to the surface and making sure their “friend” is okay!</p>
